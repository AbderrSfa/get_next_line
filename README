Get_next_line is a function that reads from a file, stdin or stdout and allows you to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.
Calling the function once reads a single line from the file, and calling the function in a loop will then allow you to read the text available on a file descriptor one line at a time until the EOF.
This project deals with memory allocation and when to free and allocate memory to prevent leaks.

A (-1) is returned if an error occurred. A (0) is returned if the file is finished reading. And a (1) is returned if a line is read.
